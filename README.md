# Rocketman

Using Java's graphics libraries, I built a basic 2D space game with functional exploration, an economy, and mining. 

Using WASD or arrow keys and space bar to use your hardpoints, you can control your space ship across the 100 randomly generated galaxies to destroy asteroids to collect resources, trade in space ports, and upgrade your ship.

The goal of the game is to rack up 50,000 credits. It's just your job 5 days a week. Each asteroids contains different resources to collect and each space station across the galaxy will sell and purchase these resources for differing amounts.

Make sure not to burn out your fuse out there alone. You can refuel, repair, and upgrade at a system station.

Technical Features:

- Basic physics collisions
- Saving/loading via text file
- Highly modular scene and object system


The game can be run through Game.java's main method. Enjoy.
